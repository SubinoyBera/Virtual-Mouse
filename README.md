# Virtual Mouse - Computer Vision Project
Control your mouse using hand gestures. Used libraries/frameworks OpenCV and Mediapipe to capture video from the webcam, process hand gestures and perform actions in real-time!!

Setup up the virtual environment with the necessary requirements:

> conda create -p venv-mouse python==3.10.x -y

> conda activate vene-mouse/

> pip install -r requirements.txt

> python main.py

## Gesture Functions:

#### 1. Move Mouse-pointer:
The thumb should be close to the index finger while both the index and middle fingers should be pointing upwards.

#### 2. Left Click: 
A left-click gesture is when the middle finger is pointing upwards while the index finger is bent downwards, and the thumb should be kept apart from the index finger.

#### 3. Right Click:
A right-click gesture is when the index finger is pointing upwards while the middle finger is bent downwards, and the thumb should be kept apart from the index finger.

#### 4. Double Click: 
A double-click gesture is when both the index and middle fingers are bent downwards while the thumb and index finger should be kept apart.

#### 5. Screenshot:
A screenshot gesture is when as  both the index and middle fingers and bent downwards while the thumb and index finger should be kept apart.
